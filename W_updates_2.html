            <h1>Southern Bengal and Northern Districts Roast in Ongoing Heatwave</h1>
           <p>Heatwave prevailed in south Bengal and many parts of the northern districts of West Bengal on Sunday as the Met department forecast it will continue, particularly in southern districts, till May 2.
            The day's maximum temperature was recorded at 44.3 degrees Celsius, 7.5 deg C above normal, at Kalaikunda in Paschim Medinipur district, the department said in a bulletin.</p>
           <p>The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has said that there is a possibility of heatwaves in India, leading to hotter summers in 2023. 
            The IMD has also issued a warning that temperatures may rise to 2-3 degrees Celsius above normal in certain parts of the Indo-Gangetic plains a
            nd eastern India during the final week of March.</p>
           <p>The summer season starts in the country around March 1 and stays till May 31.</p>
           <img src="heat_umbrella.webp" alt="map">
           <p>IIn the relatively cooler northern parts of the state, Balurghat and Malda recorded maximum temperatures of 41 deg C each.</p>
            <p>In Darjeeling and Kalimpong, the mercury, however, read 22.4 deg C and 25.2 deg C, respectively, the MeT office said.</p>
            <p>"Mainly dry westerly to northwesterly winds at lower levels continue to prevail over the region. Due to strong solar insolation, the heatwave condition is very likely to prevail over the districts during the period from April 28 to May 2," a MeT office spokesperson said.
            Due to the heatwave, roads wore a deserted look on Sunday and fewer vehicles were seen in the afternoon.</p>
