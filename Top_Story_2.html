           <h1>Kolkata, West Bengal swelters under intense heatwave; Panagarh registers highest temperature at 45.1°C</h1>

           <p>Severe heatwave conditions persisted in several districts of West Bengal on Sunday, 
           including West Midnapore, Jhargram, Bankura, and West Burdwan.</p>
           <p>Naresh Kumar, a senior scientist at IMD Delhi, stated, “We have issued a Red (danger) alert 
           for some parts of West Bengal due to prevailing heatwave-to-severe heatwave conditions. 
           Temperatures are 4 to 6.5 degrees Celsius higher than normal. Additionally, minimum temperatures
           are also above average. There is expected to be a slight drop in temperature starting from Monday.”</p>
           <p>The IMD also forecasted light rainfall for Jhargram and West Midnapore districts on Monday and Tuesday.</p>
           <p>Heatwave conditions were also observed in other South Bengal districts, including North 24 Parganas, South 24 Parganas,
                East Midnapore, Hooghly, Purulia, East Burdwan, Birbhum, Murshidabad, and Nadia. An Orange (prepare) alert for these districts
                 is expected to continue until Thursday.</p>
           <p>The state capital Kolkata recorded a maximum temperature of 40.2 degrees Celsius with 87% humidity on Sunday. The city is likely to e
               xperience hot and humid weather for the coming days.</p>
               <p>Panagarh recorded the highest maximum temperature in the state on Sunday at 45.1 degrees Celsius, 
                   followed by Midnapore and Bankura at 44.6 degrees Celsius.</p>

            <p>3-day precipitation accumulation from Monday to Thursday morning
                (TWC Met Team)</p>
            <P>Given these forecasts, a yellow watch (indicating 'stay updated') has been issued for all seven northeastern states 
            from Monday to Friday, with an upgraded orange alert (indicating 'be prepared') for Arunachal Pradesh on Tuesday.</P>
            <P>Despite significant rainfall this month, all northeastern subdivisions have experienced deficiencies. Between April 1 and 21,
                 Arunachal Pradesh received 250 mm of rain (34% below normal), while Assam and Meghalaya received 115 mm (40% below normal), 
                 and the remaining northeastern states together accumulated only 86 mm (43% below normal).</P>
            <p>In response to the intense heat, the West Bengal police administration announced on social media their decision to distribute
                 a special ‘summer kit’ to traffic cops. This kit includes umbrellas, hats, sunglasses, masks, glucose, and ORS (Oral Rehydration Solution).</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, criticising the decision to hold a seven-phase election in Bengal during peak summer, Trinamool Congress Rajya Sabha MP Saket Gokhale posted 
                on social media, “A 7-phase election in this heatwave is not just a terrible idea but also serves to suppress voter turnout. High voter turnout usually
                 means trouble for the incumbent i.e. BJP. Modi is so terrified that he’s intentionally made West Bengal go through 7 phases of polling. But the 77%+ 
                 turnout for Phase-1 shows that Bengal will not succumb to these dirty tricks.”</p>
